# Helper Utilities (Python)

This repository contains small helper functions created for **learning and revision purposes** while practicing Python.

The helpers are used across mini-projects to simplify:
- user input handling
- basic logging setup
- cross-platform screen clearing

This code is intentionally kept simple and interactive to support learning, experimentation, and revision. It is not intended to be a reusable or production-ready library.
